                <h2>What are Data Structures & Algorithms?</h2>
                Data Structures and Algorithms (often called DSA) is a core area in computer science that focuses on how
                data is organized and how problems are solved efficiently. Data structures are different ways of storing
                and organizing data so that it can be accessed and used effectively, from simple containers like arrays
                to more complex ones like trees and graphs. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or instructions that
                operate on these data structures to solve tasks such as searching, sorting, and optimizing solutions.
                The combination of data structures with well-designed algorithms helps make programs faster and more
                efficient, especially when handling large amounts of information. Learning about DSA also involves
                understanding how to measure the performance of algorithms, often using concepts like time and space
                complexity to compare their efficiency. These ideas are fundamental not just for academic study but also
                for real-world software development, where choosing the right tools can greatly improve application
                performance. By mastering DSA, programmers build strong problem-solving skills that are widely
                applicable across many areas of computing.
