                <h2>What are Discrete Structures?</h2>
                Discrete structures is a branch of mathematics that deals with objects that are countable and distinct,
                rather than continuous. It forms a core foundation for computer science because computers naturally
                operate on discrete data like numbers, symbols, and logical values. The topic includes ideas such as
                sets, logic, functions, relations, graphs, and counting techniques, all of which help model and analyze
                computational problems. A major focus is on logical reasoning and proof, which trains students to think
                precisely and justify why solutions work. Discrete structures also supports understanding algorithms,
                data structures, and network design. Overall, it develops problem-solving skills that are essential for
                both theoretical and practical aspects of computing.
